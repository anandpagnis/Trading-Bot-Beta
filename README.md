This program is a automatic trading bot. The bot works but uses elementary strategies which result in an expected loss

This is a beta version. Im trying to implement different trading strategies such as Moving averages, VAR using monte carlo simulation. So that it performs better.

In a couple weeks when I have some more financial knowledge I will try to add the above mentioned strategies into the bot. Sentiment Analysis on twitter is also on the list.
